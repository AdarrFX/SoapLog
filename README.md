# Soap Log React Project

This project is designed to act as a log for my soapmaking hobby.

## Design Goals

1: To be able to list and log entries for every soap batch I make.

2: To have information:
a. A photo
b. A description of the soap
c. The date the soap was made
d. Whether I liked the batch or not

### `Placeholder`
